# eco-ml-toolbox

Exploratory machine learning experiments using ecological and environmental datasets.

This repository is in very early development.  
I'm using it to test ideas around tabular ML, species occurrence data, and simple multimodal approaches.

### Current Status
- Initial setup  
- Data exploration planned  
- Baseline models coming soon  

### Notes
These are rough experiments — expect incomplete notebooks and ongoing updates.
